# ðŸ“„ PRD: Synthetic Churn Dataset Generator

## Project Name
Hosting & Domain Service Churn Dataset Generator

---

## Overview
Build an internal tool/script that generates a synthetic dataset simulating customer behavior in a hosting and domain service business. The generated dataset includes comprehensive product usage, support interactions, financial metrics, and engagement data. Churn prediction features are **driven by realistic behavioral patterns** commonly observed in the hosting industry.

### Use Cases:
- Prototyping churn prediction models
- Simulating user behavior for ML workflows
- Testing dashboards or analytics pipelines
- Creating sandbox datasets for training/experimentation

---

## User
Internal data scientist, ML engineer, or analyst using Cursor. They should be able to:
- Modify churn logic
- Control the number of generated records
- Export the dataset
- Understand and trace which patterns drive churn in the data

- 1000+ rows of synthetic customer data
- Includes 50+ columns reflecting hosting/domain service behavior
- Dataset focused on behavioral features for churn prediction (target column removed)

## Churn Logic

Use a rule-based scoring function to determine if a customer should churn, based on realistic patterns observed in hosting/domain service businesses.

### Score Calculation

| Feature                       | Condition                        | Score Impact |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------|
| **Service Age**              | Days since `PP_SERVICE_CREATED_DATE` < 90 | +2 |
| **Service Expiring Soon**    | Days to `PP_EXPIRATION_DATE` < 30 | +3 |
| **Low Product Diversity**    | `ALL_PRODUCT_CNT` < 2            | +1 |
| **Low Spend**                | `ALL_PRODUCT_NET_AMT` < $50      | +2 |
| **No Renewals**              | `RENEWAL_COUNT` = 0              | +2 |
| **High Support Contact**     | `TOTAL_CONTACTS` > 5             | +1 |
| **Billing Issues**           | `BILLING_CONTACTS` > 2           | +2 |
| **Retention Calls**          | `RETENTION_CONTACTS` > 0         | +1 |
| **Low Login Activity**       | `SUCCESS_LOGIN` = 0 OR `TOTAL_LOGIN` < 5 | +2 |
| **NPS Detractor**            | `NPS_DETRACTOR_COUNT` > 0        | +1 |
| **Premium Domain Issues**    | `PP_PREMIUM_FLAG` = 'Y' AND `PREMIUM_DOMAIN_PRODUCT_CNT` = 0 | +1 |
| **Short Term Contract**      | `TERM_IN_MONTHS` <= 3            | +1 |
| **High Discount Dependency** | `PP_DISCOUNT_AMT` / `PP_NET_AMT` > 0.5 | +1 |
| **No Core Products**         | `HOSTING_PRODUCT_CNT` = 0 AND `DOMAIN_PRODUCT_CNT` = 0 | +2 |
| **Technical Support Issues** | `CPANEL_CONTACTS` + `EMAIL_CONTACTS` > 3 | +1 |

### Churn Assignment

- Churn scoring logic implemented (target column removed from dataset)
- Else â†’ `'active'`
- Add ~10% noise by randomly flipping the status to simulate real-world unpredictability

### Additional Logic

**Automatic Active Status (Override):**
- `NPS_PROMOTER_COUNT` > 0 AND `ALL_PRODUCT_NET_AMT` > $100 â†’ Force `'active'`
- `RENEWAL_COUNT` > 3 AND `ALL_PRODUCT_CNT` > 5 â†’ Force `'active'`

**Automatic Inactive Status (Override):**
- `PP_SERVICE_DELETION_DATE` is not null â†’ Force `'inactive'`
- `BILLING_CONTACTS` > 5 â†’ Force `'inactive'`

## Functional Requirements
- Must generate data as a single Python script or notebook
- Columns must match the updated schema above (50+ columns)
- Churn logic must be centralized and easily modifiable
- Generate realistic date ranges for service lifecycle
- Create correlated product counts and revenue amounts
- Support contact data should follow realistic patterns
- Login activity should correlate with engagement
- Save final output as CSV with proper data types
- Print summary statistics and churn distribution after generation

---

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Fast runtime: < 10 seconds for 1000 rows
- Deterministic output with seed
- Dependencies: `pandas`, `numpy`, `faker`, and `datetime`
- Memory efficient for large datasets (up to 100K+ rows)

---

## Future Considerations
- CLI support (e.g., `python generate.py --rows 5000`)
- Add user segments or plan types
- Output in multiple formats (JSON, DB insert, etc.)
- Include behavior drift (churn logic changing over time)
